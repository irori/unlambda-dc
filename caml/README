This directory contains an Unlambda interpreter written in CAML (an ML
variant developped at the INRIA, http://www.inria.fr/ ).  See
http://caml.inria.fr/ for more information about CAML.  It is thought
that any version of CAML (or, at any rate, of OCAML) will compile
this, but the INRIA is not very keen on upward compatibility (to say
the least): this has been tested with OCAML version 2.02 (see
http://pauillac.inria.fr/ocaml/ for downloading OCAML; since version
2.03, OCAML is - presumably - free software).


To compile (using OCAML), run

  ocamlc -o unlambda unlambda.ml

or replace ocamlc by ocamlopt if your architecture (e.g. Intel or
Sparc) is supported as a native compilation target by OCAML.


To run, run

  ./unlambda < inputfile.unl

(I would have liked to permit reading the file name from the command
line, but I didn't have the OCAML manual with me, so that wasn't
possible, and I was in a hurry; sorry).


This interpreter is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License (either version 2.1 of the license, or, at your
option, any later version).  The reason for this is that it is not
certain whether linking a GPL'ed CAML program with the OCAML run-time
library (version 2.02 or less) is permitted, and I don't want to make
a special arrangement.  As this interpreter is derived from the
interpreter in SML/NJ, the latter is also put under the same license,
for coherence's sake.
